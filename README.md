# TMA4212-NumDiff
Course project using finite difference methods and finite element methods on differential equations.
*Contributors: Marius Linegaard, Bendik Skundberg Waade, Petter RÃ¸e Sundhaug, Frederick Nilsen*

The first part of our project consisted of implementing finite difference methods and finite element methods, with and without adaptive refinement techniques, on a set of known differential equations. The folder `proj1` contains these implementations.

The second part, `proj2`, is an in-depth look of the Biharmonic equation.
